                    <h1>The Sweet Irony: Why a Dentist Invented Cotton Candy</h1>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p>It’s pink, it’s impossibly fluffy, it melts the instant it hits your tongue, and let’s be honest: it
                    is essentially a cloud of pure, unadulterated sugar.</p>

                <p>Cotton candy is the quintessential carnival treat, a staple of childhood nostalgia. But here is a
                    fact that sounds like the setup to a bad joke: the machine responsible for mass-producing this
                    cavity-inducing confection was invented by... a dentist.</p>

                <p>It seems like a conspiracy theory for eternal job security, doesn't it? A professional dedicated to
                    oral hygiene creating the ultimate sugar delivery system? Yet, history confirms this delicious
                    irony. The father of the modern sugar rush was, in fact, a tooth doctor.</p>

                <h3>Meet Dr. Morrison and "Fairy Floss"</h3>
                <p>Let’s step back to Nashville, Tennessee, at the turn of the 20th century. Dr. William Morrison was a
                    prominent figure in his field, serving as the president of the Tennessee State Dental Association.
                </p>

                <p>While he spent his days peering into mouths and battling decay, his evenings were spent tinkering.
                    Dr. Morrison was an avid inventor with a sweet tooth. He teamed up with an actual confectioner, John
                    C. Wharton, to combine their skills.</p>

                <p>Before their collaboration, "spun sugar" existed, but it was an incredibly labor-intensive luxury,
                    painstakingly pulled by hand for high-society dessert decorations. Morrison and Wharton wanted to
                    bring spun sugar to the masses through automation.</p>

                <p>In 1897, they filed a patent for an "electric candy machine."</p>

                <h3>The Mechanics of Magic</h3>
                <p>The genius of their invention was its simplicity, utilizing centrifugal force—the same physics that
                    pushes you against the door when a car turns sharply.</p>

                <p>The machine had a spinning central bowl heated by electricity. When crystalline sugar was poured in,
                    the intense heat melted it into a liquid. The rapidly spinning bowl then forced that liquid sugar
                    through tiny, microscopic holes in the side.</p>

                <p>As soon as those microscopic jets of liquid sugar hit the cooler surrounding air, they solidified
                    instantly into incredibly fine, impossibly thin threads that gathered in a large outer basin.</p>

                <p>The result was a web-like, airy substance that was 99.9% air and 0.1% sugar. They called their
                    creation "Fairy Floss."</p>

                <h3>The Grand Debut: The 1904 World's Fair</h3>
                <p>Morrison and Wharton knew they had something special, but they needed the right stage to debut it.
                    They chose the grandest stage available: the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, better known as the
                    St. Louis World's Fair.</p>

                <p>This fair was legendary for culinary introductions; it’s widely credited with popularizing the waffle
                    cone, the hamburger bun, and Dr. Pepper.</p>

                <p>The duo set up their clunky, rattling electric machine and started spinning. The reception was
                    explosive. Fairgoers had never seen—or tasted—anything like it. It was practically magic; solid
                    crystals turning into edible air right before their eyes.</p>

                <p>Despite the high price of 25 cents a box (which is roughly equivalent to $8.00 today, and half the
                    cost of admission to the fair itself!), people lined up in droves.</p>

                <p>By the end of the fair, the dentist and the confectioner had sold over 68,655 boxes of Fairy Floss,
                    walking away with a massive profit.</p>

                <h3>The Dentist's Dilemma</h3>
                <p>The irony of the situation remains the best part of the story. Dr. Morrison spent his professional
                    life advising patients on how to preserve their teeth, only to become famous for inventing a machine
                    designed to coat those teeth in sugar as efficiently as possible.</p>

                <p>Was it a subconscious conflict? A brilliant business pivot? We’ll never know for sure. It’s worth
                    noting, however, that because cotton candy is mostly air, it actually contains less sugar per
                    serving than a standard can of soda or a candy bar. Perhaps that was how Dr. Morrison justified it
                    to himself.</p>

                <p>The name "Fairy Floss" eventually faded, replaced in the 1920s by "cotton candy" (a name coined by a
                    competitor who, ironically, was another dentist). But the mechanism remains largely unchanged today.
                </p>

                <p>So, the next time you are at a county fair, pulling a tuft of blue raspberry fluff from a paper cone,
                    take a moment to appreciate the sweet paradox. It might be bad for your teeth, but hey—at least the
                    inventor knew a guy who could fix them.</p>
