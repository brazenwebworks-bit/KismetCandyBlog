                    <h1>Blue Raspberry’s Secret: The Fascinating Story Behind the Electric Flavor of Summer</h1>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p>If you were a child in the last 40 years, you know the badge of honor: a tongue stained an unnatural,
                    radioactive shade of neon blue.</p>

                <p>Whether it was a slushie, a Jolly Rancher, or an Otter Pop, Blue Raspberry was the undisputed king of
                    summer flavors. It was tart, it was sweet, and it looked like nothing else found in nature.</p>

                <p>But as adults, we have to ask the question: What is a blue raspberry? Is it a rare fruit found in the
                    Amazon? A genetic mutation?</p>

                <p>The truth is much stranger. The invention of Blue Raspberry wasn’t just a marketing gimmick; it was a
                    desperate solution to a public health crisis involving the color red.</p>

                <h3>The Problem: Too Many Reds</h3>
                <p>In the mid-20th century, the candy aisle was a confusing place. If you picked up a red lollipop, it
                    was a game of Russian Roulette. Was it cherry? Strawberry? Watermelon? Cinnamon?</p>

                <p>Manufacturers were running out of distinct shades of red to signal different flavors. Raspberry,
                    which is naturally a deep pinkish-red, was often the odd one out. It needed a new identity to stand
                    out from the crowd of cherries and strawberries.</p>

                <p>But in the 1970s, the need for a new color stopped being a marketing choice and became a necessity.
                </p>

                <h3>The "Red Scare" of the 1970s</h3>
                <p>For decades, the standard food dye used to color raspberry treats was FD&C Red No. 2 (also known as
                    Amaranth). It was cheap, vibrant, and everywhere.</p>

                <p>However, in the early 1970s, Soviet scientists released studies suggesting Red No. 2 might be
                    carcinogenic. While the FDA initially hesitated, public anxiety skyrocketed. The "Red Dye Scare" was
                    in full swing. Parents stopped buying red candies, and companies scrambled to distance themselves
                    from the controversial color.</p>

                <p>Eventually, the FDA banned Red No. 2 in 1976, but the damage was already done. Raspberry needed a
                    rebrand—and fast.</p>

                <h3>Enter: Brilliant Blue</h3>
                <p>Candy and slushie makers (specifically Gold Medal and later ICEE) looked at their palettes. They
                    needed a color that was:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>FDA-approved and safe.</li>
                    <li>Visually distinct from Cherry (Red) and Strawberry (Pink).</li>
                    <li>Bright enough to attract kids.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>They found FD&C Blue No. 1, also known as "Brilliant Blue."</p>

                <p>It didn’t matter that raspberries aren't blue. The color was electric, safe, and completely unclaimed
                    by other major fruit flavors. They paired the synthetic blue dye with the tart, artificial raspberry
                    flavoring, and a star was born.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "While there is no such thing as a neon blue raspberry in nature, there is a real berry called the
                    Whitebark Raspberry (Rubus leucodermis). It grows in the American West and turns a dark,
                    bluish-purple black when ripe. Marketing teams often point to this berry to claim the flavor has
                    'natural roots,' but let’s be honest—it’s a stretch."
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Why It Tastes So Different</h3>
                <p>Have you ever noticed that Blue Raspberry doesn’t taste like actual raspberries?</p>

                <p>Real raspberries are floral and earthy. Blue Raspberry, however, is a hyper-tart, chemical punch to
                    the jaw. This is because the flavor profile is usually constructed from esters (chemical compounds)
                    typically found in bananas, cherries, and pineapples. It mimics the "idea" of a
                    raspberry—specifically the sourness—without the subtle floral notes that would get lost in a sugary
                    slushie.</p>

                <h3>The Legacy</h3>
                <p>Today, Blue Raspberry is more than a flavor; it’s a cultural icon. It represents a specific era of
                    childhood where the cooler the color, the better the taste.</p>

                <p>So next time you order that blue slushie at the movie theater, remember: you aren’t just drinking
                    sugar and ice. You’re drinking a piece of history—a clever workaround to a 1970s science scare that
                    accidentally created the most delicious color in the world.</p>
